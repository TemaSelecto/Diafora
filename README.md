<h1>TaxComp</h1>

<p>Diaforá is a tool that addresses the problem of visualizing differences between two versions of a biological taxonomy. It uses edge-drawing as the main comparison method in order to visualize differences between the two versions.  Differences are due to splits, merges, taxa moved from a group into another, as well as renamed, added or exclused taxa.</p>
